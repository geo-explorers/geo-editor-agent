# Geo Knowledge Graph — Press Review

Generate a press review for a Space: pull what the press is actually covering (Google News / web search), compare it against what's already published on Geo, and hand editors a ranked, justified list of **what to publish next and why**.

The point is not to summarize the news. It's to surface **actionable editorial opportunities** — real stories the press is covering that Geo is missing entirely.

**Read-only.** This skill compares and recommends. It never creates, updates, or deletes anything on Geo. Acting on a recommendation is a separate, explicit step that goes through `geo-orchestrate` (with dry-run + existence-check safeguards).

## When to apply

Use this skill when an editor or curator wants to:

- Run a **press review for a Space** — what's the press covering that we've missed?
- Decide **what to publish next**, ranked by priority.
- Check whether a specific story **is already on Geo** before publishing it.
- **Discover sources** for a topic + date (e.g. "Senate runoff", Jan 15 2026 → relevant articles).
- Build a **timeline** for a past date, not just today's cycle.

## The two buckets (the core output)

For every external story the press is covering, classify it against Geo. **Use these exact labels in the output** — they're written so a non-technical editor instantly knows what to do:

| Label (use verbatim) | Meaning | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ **Already on Geo** | A Geo News story clearly covers this event, with sources. | No action. |
| 🆕 **Not on Geo yet — publish new** | No Geo story matches this event; it's missing from Geo entirely. | Publish — this is the opportunity. |

Do **not** use the bare phrase "not covered" — editors don't know what it means. Always say **"Not on Geo yet — publish new"** (or, in tight UI, the chip "🆕 Not on Geo yet").

> **Only these two buckets exist — there is no third category.** A story either matches something already on Geo (✅) or it doesn't (🆕). If a Geo story covers the event, mark it ✅ and move on — do **not** assess, rank, or report how fresh, complete, or up-to-date existing Geo stories are, and do **not** add any "missing fact" / "delta" column (that comparison is out of scope for this version). The whole deliverable is the **🆕 publish-next list**; ✅ is just the "already handled" list.

The deliverable is **two tables** (both rendered as real markdown tables, never bullet lists):
- **🆕 table** — `Priority | Headline | Why | Sources`.
- **✅ table** — `Headline | Geo entity ID`.

In both, the **Headline cell is a clickable markdown link** to the story's primary source.

**Make the Headline itself a clickable link to the story's primary source** — `[Australia and Fiji sign mutual defense pact](https://apnews.com/article/…)` — so the editor clicks the headline and lands straight on the source (this is the editor's #1 requested shortcut). Use the strongest/first source as the headline's link target.

**Also list EVERY source in the Sources column, each a clickable link.** Not just the headline's one — all of them. A story backed by five outlets shows five links: `[AP](url) · [FT](url) · [Guardian](url)`. Render each as a markdown link to its actual article URL — never a bare outlet name. If you couldn't capture a URL for a source, drop it rather than listing a dead name.

## How it works — two halves, then match

### Half 1 — Geo coverage (deterministic, via the GraphQL API)

Run the coverage map to get everything Geo has published in the window:

```bash
bun run scripts/press-review-coverage-map.ts --space AI --days 7 --json geo-coverage.json
```

This produces `geo-coverage.json` — every News story with name, publish date, topics, sources (by outlet), and claim count. This is the "what we already have" side. It also flags **went-quiet topics** and **single-source stories** purely from Geo data (useful even before the external comparison).

> **Empty/thin baseline — say so explicitly.** If the space has ~0 News stories in the window (or under ~10 total), the coverage map's reassuring "(none)" gap lines are **meaningless as a comparison** — with no baseline, *every* external story will classify 🆕. Do not present this as a gap analysis. Tell the editor plainly: *"this space has no coverage baseline in this window; treat the output as a seeding list, not a gap analysis."* The script prints a `⚠ NO/THIN BASELINE` warning in this case — surface it, don't bury it.

**Half 1 uses the GraphQL API (`api-testnet.geobrowser.io`), addressed by SPACE ID — NOT the Hypergraph MCP connector.** Every DAO space is reachable there by its 32-hex space id (e.g. World affairs = `89bd89bf28ff8a0963faf92a8c905e20`, ~1,175 News stories). If the bun script can't run in your environment, query GraphQL directly (see `geo-query`) — same source of truth.

> **⚠ NEVER build the coverage map from the Hypergraph MCP connector.** It exposes only a curated subset of spaces (World affairs, US Politics, and others are NOT in it) and — critically — it **silently fuzzy-matches a space name to the nearest one it does have** (a real case: `space="World affairs"` matched to **"AI"** with no error), which would produce a coverage map of the *wrong* space and silently corrupt the whole review.
>
> **Space-verification guard (mandatory before any coverage map):** confirm the resolved space's `id` AND `page.name` EXACTLY match what was requested — `{ space(id:"<SPACE_ID>") { id page { name } } }`. If the id returns "not found", or the name doesn't match, or a tool "helpfully" substituted a different space → **STOP and report it. Never proceed on a fuzzy-matched or substituted space.** A blank/absent result means "use the GraphQL path," not "this space is empty."

### Half 2 — External press (via web search)

Use the agent's **web search / Google News** to gather what the press is actually covering for the same Space and window. Search by the Space's main topics and the date range. For each external story capture: headline, outlet, **date, and the article URL** (the URL is required — it becomes the clickable source in the report), and a one-line summary.

Guidance:
- **Topic-lane fan-out (mandatory): enumerate 8–10 distinct topic lanes BEFORE searching, then run at least one search per lane.** Derive lanes from the space's recurring topics (`geo-coverage.json` `topicCoverage`) plus the window's obvious threads (e.g. for World affairs: Ukraine/NATO, Iran, Gaza, Sudan, China/Pacific, domestic-politics-of-major-powers, …). A single-query or 3–4-lane run reads as "weak search" — the shortfall is breadth, not the search tool (verified in a Claude-vs-GPT A/B: same tool quality, the deeper fan-out found 2× the gaps).
- For a **past date**, scope every search to that date window, and **discard any source whose article date falls outside the window** — search engines bleed adjacent-week results in.
- Don't stop at the first page. Web search is lazy by default — explicitly gather the top N per topic. Claude's web search has no date operator and is US-centric: compensate with more, varied queries per lane (add outlet names like FT/Guardian/AP for non-US angles).
- **Keep each source's URL** alongside the outlet name. Don't discard it after reading — the report must link to it.
- **Prefer specific articles over live-blogs / topic hubs.** A page like `cnn.com/.../live-news/iran-war` or `aljazeera.com/.../iran-war-live` covers an *entire* topic, not one event — it is not a clean source for a specific story unless that exact development is in it. Capture the specific article; treat live-blogs as leads to chase, not as citations.

### Half 3 — Match & classify (the LLM does this)

For each external story, find the best-matching Geo story from `geo-coverage.json` (match on the **event**, not exact wording — same companies/people/action). Then:

- **A Geo story matches the event** → ✅ Already on Geo (no action; do not assess whether it's "fresh enough" — matched = done).
- **No match** → 🆕 Not on Geo yet — publish new.

Rigor requirements (each verified live to prevent a real mis-flag):
- **Every ✅ row cites the matching Geo story's entity ID** (from the coverage map) — the editor must be able to open the exact entity, not re-search it.
- **Before calling anything 🆕, re-check with an UNDATED search of the News-story TYPE in this space** — not just the window's coverage map, and not a generic name search. The coverage map only sees stories *inside* the window, and it filters on `Publish date`, so a story is invisible to it in **two** ways: (a) Geo published it a day or two before the window (e.g. an India–Japan summit published Jul 2 for a Jul 3–6 review), or (b) its `Publish date` is a **typo** (a real story had `2025-07-26` where its own text said 2026 — off by a year, so it fell outside every window). Either way the story exists; the undated re-check is what catches it. Query:
  ```graphql
  { entities(typeId: "e550fe517e904b2c8fffdf13408f5634", spaceId: "SPACE_ID",
      filter: { name: { includesInsensitive: "KEYWORD" } }, first: 25) { id name createdAt } }
  ```
  Run it per candidate 🆕 with a couple of salient keywords (person, country, event). **`first: 25`, not 5 — and if the result set comes back full, it may be truncated: a common keyword (`Venezuela`) can fill all slots with unrelated stories and hide the real match, so re-query with a more distinctive keyword (`International Criminal Court`) before concluding "no match."** (This exact truncation once returned five earthquake stories and hid the ICC-withdrawal story, nearly recommending a duplicate.) If a real News story comes back, it's ✅ (cite the ID), not 🆕. Only after this check comes back empty is it a genuine gap.
- **Cross-space re-check for off-beat 🆕s.** The coverage map is single-space by construction and never looks sideways. For any 🆕 whose subject is plausibly another space's beat (health, technology, crypto, industries — e.g. an Ebola vaccine trial, a chip launch, a stablecoin ruling), run the **same undated re-check with the `spaceId` dropped** (or against the sibling topical spaces). Verified real: an Ebola-vaccine story came back "no match" in World affairs while living in the **health** space — publishing the 🆕 would have duplicated it. One extra batched request; cheap insurance against cross-space duplicates.
- **Match on the story's CLAIMS, not just its title + description.** A Geo News story's specific facts live in its `Notable claims` relations (verified: ~17 claims on a typical story), which the coverage map does NOT include. Before you assert a match is only partial or that Geo "lacks" some fact, fetch the candidate story's claims and read them — the fact is often already there (e.g. the Kyiv "68 missiles / 351 drones" numbers were already claims). Title+description alone under-reports what Geo has.
  **MANDATORY (not judgment): whenever a 🆕 suggestion is of the form "Geo has a related story but not this specific thread/development," you MUST fetch that related story's `Notable claims` and confirm the development is absent from them before keeping it as 🆕.** Skipping this is exactly what mis-flagged the "Mojtaba absent from the funeral" thread as new when the funeral stories already carried those claims. No "related but new" 🆕 ships without the claims read.
  ```graphql
  { entity(id: "STORY_ID") { relations(first: 100) { nodes { type { name } toEntity { name } } } } }  # read the Notable claims (100 — busy stories can carry many)
  ```

**These rigor checks are essentially free — do not skip them.** Batched, all the undated re-checks for a full review cost ~4 s and all the claims-reads ~2 s (they read as expensive, but a single GraphQL request each covers all candidates). The undated re-check, the cross-space re-check, and the claims read each prevented a real mis-flag in testing.

Then **rank** the 🆕 items and **justify** each rank.

### Source-faithfulness gate (do this BEFORE listing any source — non-negotiable)

The #1 failure mode of this skill: recommending a *specific* story and attaching *loosely-related* sources that don't actually back it. Before a source appears in the report, it must pass both checks:

1. **The source actually substantiates THIS specific story** — not just the broad topic. A story titled "5th round of US-Iran ceasefire talks in Washington; Hormuz de-confliction cell agreed" needs sources that report *that development*. A generic "Iran war — live" blog is **not** a valid source for it. If you can't point to where the source states the claim, **drop that source** — don't pad the list.
2. **The recommended story is only as specific as its sources support.** Don't synthesize a precise headline (named round number, named venue, named mechanism) that the sources don't actually state. Phrase the recommendation to match what the sources say; if the sources are vaguer, make the recommendation vaguer.
3. **When tier-1 sources disagree on a number, cite the range — never a single figure the newest source doesn't back.** Death tolls and casualty counts routinely conflict across outlets and over time (e.g. Chile floods reported as 3 / 10 / 13 dead by three outlets on different days). Give the range and the most recent tier-1 figure ("3–13 dead depending on source; 13 per JPost, Jul 21"), not one number stated as fact.

If, after the gate, a 🆕 item has **no source that genuinely backs its specific claim**, do NOT recommend it as a confident gap — either rewrite it to the level the sources support, or drop it. Better to recommend fewer, well-sourced opportunities than many over-specified ones. (Same discipline as `geo-describe`'s accuracy leg: verify the *framing*, not just that something is roughly on-topic.)

### Ranking signals

- **Press volume** — how many outlets are covering it (bigger story).
- **Source quality** — tier-1 outlets (Reuters, Bloomberg, FT, AP…) weight higher.
- **Topic centrality** — does it hit a topic this Space actively maintains? (Cross-check `topicCoverage` in the JSON.)
- **Recency / momentum** — breaking vs. days-old.
- **Graph-fit** — does it connect to people/topics/stories already on Geo (richer contribution)?

## Source discovery mode

Second mode: editor gives a **topic (or URL) + a date**, and the skill returns relevant **sources**, not a full review.

> Example: editor enters "Senate runoff", target date 2026-01-15 → the skill web-searches news on that topic around that date and returns ranked candidate sources (headline, outlet, date, URL), flagging which are already cited in Geo.

Steps:
1. Web-search the topic scoped to the date window.
2. Pull candidate articles (headline, outlet, date, URL).
3. Cross-check against Geo (`geo-query` or `geo-coverage.json`): is this source already cited on an existing story?
4. Return a ranked source list, newest/most-authoritative first, marking ones Geo already uses.

This is the timeline-building use case — let editors reconstruct coverage for any date, not just today.

## How editors receive the output

- **In chat / terminal:** the ranked **🆕 table** under a clear heading like **"TOP PUBLISH OPPORTUNITIES — ACT ON THESE FIRST"**, each row with its *why* and its **sources as clickable markdown links**, and the **headline itself linked to its primary source**. Then a **✅ Already on Geo table** (`Headline | Geo entity ID`, headline also linked) showing what's handled. **Both are markdown tables — do NOT render ✅ as a prose paragraph or bullet list.**
- **Clickable headlines:** every headline is a markdown link to its primary source — the editor clicks the headline to reach the article.
- **Status chips:** label each row with the verbatim status — **🆕 Not on Geo yet** or **✅ Already on Geo**. Never the bare phrase "not covered".
- **Sources line — ALL of them, always linked:** list every outlet covering the story, each as its own link — `Sources: [NPR](url) · [CNN](url) · [AP](url) · [Reuters](url) · [Euronews](url)`. Don't truncate to a "main" source. An editor must be able to click straight to any article. A source with no URL is dropped, not shown as plain text.
- **As a file (optional):** the agent can write the review to a markdown or JSON file so it's shareable / feeds a future dashboard. In the JSON, each source is `{ outlet, url }`, not a bare string. `geo-coverage.json` is always available as the structured Geo-side artifact.

Lead the editor with the **top 3–5 🆕 stories** — that's the "publish next" list. Always attach the source URLs so they can verify.

## Hand-off (this skill recommends; it never publishes)

When the editor picks something to act on:

- **"Publish this missing story"** → hand the headline, the candidate source URLs, and any related Geo thread ID to **`geo-orchestrate`**, which runs the existence-check (golden rule — never duplicate), generates a dry-run script, shows the ops, and publishes only on explicit "go".
- **"Tell me more about what Geo has on X"** → hand off to **`geo-query`**.

The review itself is safe by construction — read + compare + rank only.

## Caveats / known limits

- **Web search is non-deterministic.** It can miss stories or surface low-quality sources. Treat the external half as "best-effort press scan," not an exhaustive feed. State this to the editor — a 🆕 ("Not on Geo yet") is a *candidate*, confirm before publishing.
- **Matching is judgment, not exact.** Same event can have very different headlines. Match on entities + action, and when unsure, mark it 🆕 and let the editor decide rather than silently calling it covered.
- **Sources on Geo are labeled strings, not entities.** Outlet is parsed from a `"Headline | Outlet"` label; ~⅓ have no parseable outlet. So "is this source already cited" is fuzzy. (Structured Source entities would fix this — open question for the core team.)
- **"This Space's topics"** is inferred from existing coverage (`topicCoverage`), since there's no canonical Space→Topics map yet.
- **Publish date** is whatever Geo stores on `94e43fe8…`; if it's ingestion rather than event date, timelines are approximate.

## Schema (verified 2026-05-08, AI space)

- News story type id: `e550fe517e904b2c8fffdf13408f5634` (the type entity lives in Root; News story *entities* live in topical spaces — query by this type ID per space).
- Publish date property: `94e43fe8faf241009eb887ab4f999723` (datetime).
- Relation type names: `Topics`, `Sources`, `Notable claims`.
